# matplotlib-challenge

Intoduction:
Matplotlib is an addition to what we have learned in Pyhton so far. Specifically, matplotlib is a plotting library that is used when including different types of diagrams into the data analysis, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots. This is beneficial to easily demonstrate the data that is being analyzed. Each of the graphs has its' own purpose, thereofre, it is helpful to understand where each of the diagrams would be the most useful. In this specific experiment, we are not adding diagrams to the report, but reinforcing what was taught the prior week.

Overview of the Data:
Using a combination of pandas, matplotlib, and basic coding functions, we were able to determine a summary statistics that includes the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean between the Tumor Volume and the Drug Regimen. Afterwards, we were asked to display a bar graph AND a pie chart using both pandas and pyplot. Although both are pretty simlar, they each have their own syntax in which the code needs to be placed in order for it to be properly excuted. More information can be seen in the "Methods" section. Lastly, a box and whisker plot along with a scatter plot was used to determine any potential outliers or trends that can be seen from this relationship. 

This can be extremely beneficial in scientific experiments, or even in the business field when wanting to see correlations between specific variables. Matplotlib and Pandas can be used in a collaborative manner in order to execute the diagrams that may be required.  
 

Methods:
For this experiment, basic functions that were previously mentioned were used. Functions such as ".mean()" and ".sum()" were used, but statistical language was also included. These include ".std", ".sem", ".var", and even Pearson's r.  By findingthese variables, we were able to determine the expected tasks. Additionally, diagrams such as the bar graph, pie chart, scatter plot, and box and whisker plot functions were used to illustrate this information. there is different syntax used in pandas and pyplot, however, similar functions were used. This is written in the following functions: ".plot.bar", ".plot.pie", ".plot.scatter", and ".plot.boxplot". Correlation and regression was used using scipy as stats. "stats.linregress" was used for linear regression. 

With the proper variables in each of them, the formulas were executed in a professional manner, and the diagrams were successfully shown. 

Conclusions:
In conclusion, this week's challenge showed us how we can continue reinfocing skills that we have previously learned, while also adding matplotlib's language. In other words, pandas was used to determine the statistical summary of the variables, and even used in certain diagrams, however, we were able to incorporate matplotlib in a manner that helped the information seem clearer. Skills such as grouping, figuring out the mean, and standard deviation, and plotting diagrams was used for the tasks to be comepleted in this assignment.
